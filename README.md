Landing Page for Links to the Helios 1.4 Project
[Helios 1.4](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/Helios14) now resides at https://github.com/BlueFinBima/Helios14, and is no longer accepting new issues.
## Fear Not!
[Helios 1.6](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios) is the next step in the journey, and a lot of work under thce covers, principally by @derammo and his team of testers will provide a foundation for future improvements to the virtual cockpit environment.
The last release of [the BlueFinBima fork of Helios 1.4](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/Helios14/releases/tag/1.4.2020.0530) can still be downloaded, however the future is 
very definitely Helios 1.6 whose releases will appear [here](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/releases).

The [Helios 1.4 Wiki](https://github.com/BlueFinBima/Helios14/wiki) remains available, however the only wiki to be maintained is at [Helios Virtual Cockpit](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/wiki)
